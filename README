This is a patched version of Lua 5.2 (work2) that, on exiting
an in <env> do ... end block, checks if <env> has a __leave
metamethod and calls it if it exists, passing <env>.

The metamethod is called on normal exits, returns, breaks, and
errors. In the latter case the error object is passed as the
second argument to __leave. Currently an error inside a __leave
handler shadows the error that caused it to be called.

See leave-example/in.lua for several examples of __leave in
action.

The original README is below the fold.
